An updated version of {url-hubpress}[HubPress] is now available with the following new features:

== New feature: Syntax Highlighting
Most users of {url-hubpress}[HubPress] are tech bloggers and find themselves writing many command-line examples in the blog posts they write. Code Highlighting is now implemented in  {url-hubpress}[HubPress].

[source, javascript,indent=0]
----
function copyit(theField) {
  var selectedText = document.selection;
  if (selectedText.type == 'Text') {
    var newRange = selectedText.createRange();
    theField.focus();
    theField.value = newRange.text;
  }
}
----

== New feature: Alternative Title
If your native language does not use latin characters, you can now specify an alternative title that is used to build the URL of your blog post.

This feature is enabled through a new attribute *hp-alt-title*: 
[source, asciidoc]
----
= テストをしてください
:hp-alt-title: Please test it
----

The URL format of the post is *http://myblog.com/2015/03/15/please-test-it.html* and the title in the blog post remains as *テストをしてください*

== New feature: Tags generation
No more 404 on the tags link! Tag page generation is now available.
Tags pages are built when you publish a post and the site is re-paginated. It may take a short while for the tag cloud to update on your site.

== Documentation
Our documentation is now available in Chinese and Spanish: thanks to our dedicated community contributors!
