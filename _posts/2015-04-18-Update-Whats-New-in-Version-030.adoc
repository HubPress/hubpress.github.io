This release of HubPress implements user token changes made to the https://developer.github.com/changes/2015-02-20-migration-period-removing-authorizations-token/[GitHub Authorization API], that require immediate action from all HubPress Bloggers.

IMPORTANT: You must update your version of HubPress before the 20 April 2015.

== How Does the New API Affect HubPress?
When you logon to HubPress, a personal token is created in your GitHub account. With version 0.3.0, the personal token is now generated according to the environment (Browser and Operating System), and is deleted at each login:

The consequence is that you can no longer have multiple tabs in the *same browser* open to work on your HubPress blog instance. You can work around this issue by starting two instances of HubPress in different browsers, or by accessing your posts through the GitHub user interface in your blog repository.

If you have never upgraded your instance of HubPress before, follow this tutorial to update your version before 20 April 2015.

== Known Issues In This Release
While testing the release, The Docs Guy found what appeared to be a rogue commit on config.json on 12 March 2015 by hanwengchen (one of the community translators) that appears in the /master branch. There's nothing to worry about: the change was reverted later in the commit for the release. You can upgrade with confidence.

A full list of other notable changes can be found in the {url-changelog}[CHANGELOG].
