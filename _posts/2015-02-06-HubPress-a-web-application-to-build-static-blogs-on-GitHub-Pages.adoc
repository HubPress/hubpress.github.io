As {url-jekyll}[Jekyll], {url-octopress}[Octopress] or {url-awestruct}[Awestruct], the goal of {url-hubpress}[HubPress] is to build static content on {url-gh-pages}[Github Pages]. 

These tools are really great, but we wanted to provide a tool that is more *user-friendly* and *accessible* for the average person.
Another reason is because we love the {url-asciidoc}[Asciidoc] markup and we wanted a way to contribute to its development. 

That's why we made {url-hubpress}[HubPress].


With the usual tools building a blog on {url-gh-pages}[Github Pages] requires a decent amount of technical knowledge (you need to know git, to install ruby, to learn a build process ...).

To provide a better user experience, we made a web interface based on http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[javascript] version.

With HubPress all you need is an internet connection and a {url-github}[GitHub] account, *that's it*!

To save or publish a post, just one click is necessary. We focus on accessibility, you just have to focus on writing.


{url-hubpress}[HubPress] is : 

* *easy to use*: no technical skills required 
* *free*: no subscription, you don't have to pay rent for a server
* *yours*: once {url-hubpress}[HubPress] is installed in your repository {url-github}[GitHub], you can live alone if you want. 

Please find here attached an "how to" video which shows you the simplicity of publishing your own blog post with HubPress.
