As {url-jekyll}[Jekyll], {url-octopress}[Octopress] or {url-awestruct}[Awestruct], the goal of {url-hubpress}[HubPress] is to build static content on {url-gh-pages}[Github Pages]. 

These tools are really great, but we wanted to provide a tool more *user-friendly* and *accessible* for the majority of people.
Another point is that we love the {url-asciidoc}[Asciidoc] markup and we looked for a way to contribute to its development. 

That's why we made {url-hubpress}[HubPress].


With the usual tools, to build a blog on {url-gh-pages}[Github Pages] require a minimum of technical knowledge (you need to know git, to install ruby, to learn a build process ...).

To provide a better user experience, we made a web interface based on http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[javascript] version.

With HubPress, all you need is an internet connection and a {url-github}[GitHub] account, *that's all*!

To save or publish a post, just one click is necessary. We focus on accessibility then now you can focus on writing.


{url-hubpress}[HubPress] is : 

* *easy to use*, without technical skills required, 
* *free*, no subscription, no server's rent,
* *yours*, {url-gh-pages}[Github Pages] will expose your blog and the admin interface, once {url-hubpress}[HubPress] is installed in your repository {url-github}[GitHub], you can live alone if you want. 

Here's a video which shows you the publication of a blog post :
