== Static pages
You can now create static pages by adding the attributes `:hp-type: page` in your post.

After saving, it will generate a file in the folder *_posts/{title-slugify}.adoc* or *_posts/{hp-alt-title-slugify}.adoc* if you use the attribute `:hp-alt-title:`.

After publishing, it will generate an html file at the root of the repository.

You can now add entries in the navigation of your blog.
In the *Settings* panel, there is a new tab *Navigation*:

== The new preview
We added a new preview with the content of the generated HTML document for the selected theme:

And you can display it in full size with the button:

== The Blog path
There is a new field in the *HubPress* tab of the *Settings* page name *Blog path*:

With this field you can specify the path where the pagination of your posts will be generate. 
So you can now create a page with the title *index* (or `:hp-alt-title: index`) that will be the home of your website.
Then you can create an entry in the navigation that will be link on the pagination path.

Here is the navigation for our website:

Actually these entries are only available in themes *Casper* and *Ghostium*

== Theme Casper
The theme *Casper* has been updated.
This version is really beautiful and really comfortable for reading.

This theme is developed by the team of http://ghost.io/[Ghost] and sources are available here https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper

== Major technical changes
Now HubPress use https://nuxtjs.org[Nuxt.js] instead of using an homemade build. It will increase the stability of the build and certainly make contributions easier.

We have also integrated http://lokijs.org/#/[Loki.js] in our stack to replace https://pouchdb.com[PouchDB]

== Contributing
Because donation is not the only way to help an opensource project, we made a page which list some kind of contribution:

https://hubpress.github.io/contributing.html

Also we are now on {url_oc}[Open Collective]!

We still have to define tiers, but if you want to help us with donations and become one of our backers or sponsors, {url_oc}[Open Collective] is the right place to go.

== Thanks
We wish to thank all those who have supported us since the beginning of the project.

A big thank to https://twitter.com/peterlawrey/[Peter Lawrey] for having backed us.
