== The configuration form

You do not need to change the *config.json* anymore, now you can do it with the *Configuration form*.
This form appears when the configuration of your repository is not done.
You have to set the mandatory fields (username, repository name and the branch) and the domain name if you have one.

Click on the *Ok, let's go!* button and you will be redirect to the login form.
Then login and the configuration will be save on your repository.

That's it!

== A new theme is here: The Shell

Some of you wanted to have a dark theme so we added one.
You can now use the theme *the-shell* in your settings, here is a sample of the result with my personal blog:

== Some fixes

We have fixed a bug on the generation of tags, thanks to Krzysztof Zbiciński https://github.com/zbicin[@zbicin].

We have also fixed the highlighting of code blocks, here is a example with the theme *casper*:

== What's next?

For the next version, we hope to add the static page feature and why not the sitemap generation.

As usual, if you love HubPress, we’d love to hear why you love it. Why not show your love by sharing this post, or perhaps consider donating through PayPal or Gratipay to HubPress.

And if there is something about HubPress you think we can do better, tell us! We can only improve the tool if you open feature requests in GitHub.

Thanks for using HubPress, and keep sharing!
