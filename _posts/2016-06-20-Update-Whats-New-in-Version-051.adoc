== Upgrade your instance

To upgrade your instance you have to create a pull request on your repository.
Go to:

```shell
https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>/compare/<branch>...HubPress:<branch>
```

For example for our blog, the username is *HubPress*, the repository name is *blog.hubpress.io* and we use the branch *gh-pages*, so the url is:

```shell
https://github.com/HubPress/blog.hubpress.io/compare/gh-pages...HubPress:gh-pages
```

If you use the branch master like Jared does (his username is *jaredmorgs*, the repository name is *jaredmorgs.github.io*):

```shell
https://github.com/jaredmorgs/jaredmorgs.github.io/compare/master...HubPress:master
```

Then you have to create a pull request with the listed changes and merge it.

The last action is to log into your HubPress administration console. 
Go to the *Settings* page and *Save*. 
This action rebuilds all your blog posts with the improvements featured in this blog. 

And voilà!

== Themes

WARNING: Breaking Change. Action required.

Release 0.4.0 added two new themese: ghostium and uno-zen. 

What we noticed is that the theme folders used a mixture of upper and lower case, which made it tricky to set the theme correctly in the Admin console.

In {release} *all theme names have been changed to lowercase*. 
This is breaking change, and you will need to check that the theme you've chosen in the Settings are lowercase.

Refer to the folder names in the `/themes` folder in your repository, or in the `Administration.adoc` Admin Guide. 

== Multi-user Support for Post Attribution

Technically, HubPress already allowed to you set a collaborator on your repo so more than one user could write posts. 

What HubPress didn't do was honour the post creator (author) if the settings were changed, and the site was regenerated. 

With {release}, if you write a blog post, your GitHub user name will always be attached to the post. 

If you create a blog post, then another blogger on your team publishes it, the person who originally created the post is credited with writing the post.

In a future release, we plan on enhancing how writer attribution is handled in the post, so stay tuned.

== Author page

With the *{release}* release, the author page is now available!

The author page regroups all the posts for a specific author.

Here is an example from our blog:

== Edit and Delete Blog Posts

You no longer have to "delete" blogs posts by reusing an unwanted, unpublished blog post. 

The action overflow (three dots menu) next to each of your posts now has a `Delete` button.

== Synchronization

Previous releases required you to reauthenticate in the HubPress Administration Console to synchronize your local content.

With the {release} release, we introduce the *Synchronize button*:

== Solarized theme

Solarized is now the default theme for the editor, you can switch easily between light and dark with one button:

== Includes

You can now use includes in your AsciiDoc content:

== Gist

Developers use gist to store code snippets, and with {release} you can now use the gist macro to integrate those snippets in your post.

For example with the gist https://gist.github.com/anthonny/7786310 the usage is as follows:

== Editor Validation for Blog Posts

In versions prior to {release}, if you didn't have a Level 1 heading starting your blog post, you were not able to save your blog post. The error that displayed as a result of this was not clear, which caused frustration for some users.

In {release}, the editor now has basic validation built-in.
If you don't start your blog with a Level 1 heading, there are no Preview or Save buttons in the editor. This is a visual clue to check your blog structure. 

If you want some tips on writing successful blog posts with HubPress, check out the _Writers' Guide_ in your repository.

== Documentation 

The documentation for HubPress has undergone further improvements to better align the content.

The Administration guide has had a content shuffle to remove information that should have been in the Writer's Guide.

The Writer's Guide had some stray Administration content in it, which has now been moved into it's proper home.

Check out the docs and let us know if you see room for improvement. 

== Documentation Moving to GitBook

Look out for the HubPress docs you see in your forked repository on https://gitbook.com in the very near future. 

GitBook are huge supporters of Open Source projects, and make managing documentation for your project or your organisation easy. 
The team has been very generous in offering HubPress an Open Source license to use for our GitHub organisation.

This allows Jared to separate documentation updates from code releases, and allows you to make in-line comments directly on the hosted docs. 
No Pull Request required.
It's an easy way to provide quick feedback on the documentation, so the team can make improvements in rapid iteration.

Jared will migrate the user guides currently in your repository over to https://www.gitbook.com/@hubpress/ and will re-align the README.adoc with links to these new resources.  

== Donations
